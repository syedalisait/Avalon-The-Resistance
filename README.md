So the initial part of Avalon game starts with players closing their eyes.

1. First the Evil players alone open their eyes to see each other

2. Then Merlin Opens his eyes to see all Evil players except Modred

3. Then Perceival opens his eyes to see two players namely Merlin and Morgana

In this phase people cheat by opening their eyes when they shouldn't be opening.

So this site basically provides the initial phase to be played without anyone closing their eyes.

All they need to do is add their name and their role.

It automatically reveals the players whom they can see.
